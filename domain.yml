      Fund Managers – Your investment is managed by fund managers who have a high
      level of educational and professional credentials and appropriate investment
      managerial experience. Diversification – Mutual Funds aim to reduce the volatility
      of returns and the risk by diversification. They invest in a number of companies
      across a broad section of industries / sectors. With a small investment, an
      investor can achieve diversification that would have otherwise not been possible
      if the investor invests directly in those securities. Liquidity – Open-ended
      Mutual Funds are priced daily and can be redeemed anytime. This mean that investors
      can redeem their holdings in Mutual Funds anytime.   Low transaction costs –
      Since Mutual Funds are a pool of money of many investors, the amount of investment
      made in securities is large. A small management fee is charged by the company,
      which if invested directly would have cost an individual investor a lot. Transparency
      – Prices of open ended Mutual Funds are announced daily. The portfolio is also
      disclosed in the monthly Fund Managers Report.

  utter_loseprinciple:
  - text: Because the value of a fund fluctuates, when you sell (“redeem”) your shares,
      the price may be more or less than what you paid for it. Just as the value of
      your home doesn’t always stay the same, neither does the value of a mutual fund.
